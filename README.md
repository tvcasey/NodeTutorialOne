# NodeTutorialOne

This looks like a good project to learn typescript and postgresql databases, but I need to focus on the Mern Stack, so I leave this project for maybe a future trial.

It is Duomly Youtube Channel, course Node.js Course Lesson 1: Start the project with Nest.js.  Downloading and figuring out how to setup this tutorial was a little challenging and I'm glad to have figure the preliminary things out.

This looks like a good tutorial to follow to expand my knowledge of Node with other packages, but not right now.
